1. From the submitted papers, the organizer chooses at most two to be given as **20-minute** presentations by those who submitted them **with slides**.
1. Students whose submissions are not chosen for 20-minute presentations are exposed to being called upon for a **5-minute** presentation **without slides**.

## Choosing Papers
In general, you should choose papers related to your key areas of interest.

However, to get students started on a few themes, here are a few topics to consider for Spring 2020.
1. [Spatial Macro and Trade](spatial_list.md)
1. [Machine Learning in Macro](machine_learning_macro.md)

But to repeat: feel no pressure to stay within these themes, or even within those papers on the topics.
