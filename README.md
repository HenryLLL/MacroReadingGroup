## Reading Group Rules
1. The reading group is aimed for UBC PhD students in years 2 and above.  We won't accept first-year students.
1. You **must** submit a paper to attend the reading group each week.
1. Regular attendence is expected. 
1. We will be discussing papers mostly on macro topics, but there is in general no restrictions on topics.
1. Every week each student submits a paper of their choice the week before the reading group.
1. From the submitted papers, the organizer chooses at most two to be given as **20-minute** presentations by those who submitted them **with slides**. [Some guidelines from Henry](guidelines_Henry.md)
1. Students whose submissions are not chosen for 20-minute presentations are exposed to being called upon for a **5-minute** presentation **without slides**.  Bring notes along with the paper you read each week so you can keep track of your quick discussion.

## Choosing Papers
In general, you should choose papers related to your own  areas of interest.

However, to get students started on a few themes, here are a few topics to consider for Spring 2020.
1. [Spatial Macro and Trade](spatial_list.md)
1. [Machine Learning in Macro](machine_learning_macro.md)

But to repeat: feel no pressure to stay within these themes, or even within those papers on the topics.
